# üéØ **Rock vs. Mine Classification Report**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

This report analyzes a dataset consisting of **60 numerical measurements** from a sonar signal.
The purpose of the data is to help a machine learning model classify whether a given sonar signal sample corresponds to a **Rock** or a **Mine (metal object)**.

üëâ This type of dataset is commonly used in signal processing tasks where objects are classified based on sonar return patterns.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Overview

* ‚úÖ **Number of Data Points (Features):** 60
* ‚úÖ **Range of Values:**

  * Minimum: **0.0044**
  * Maximum: **1.0**
* ‚úÖ **Data Type:**
  Continuous normalized values between **0 and 1**.

### Example Feature Vector:

```
0.0453, 0.0523, 0.0843, 0.0689, ..., 0.0052, 0.0044
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

Given the sonar return values from 60 different frequency bins or angles, we aim to classify:

* ‚úÖ **Rock (R)** ‚Äî Naturally occurring solid aggregate.
* ‚úÖ **Mine (M)** ‚Äî Man-made metal object, potentially dangerous.

üëâ This is a **binary classification problem** in the domain of signal classification.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Characteristics

* The data seems to follow a transient pattern (small ‚Üí peak ‚Üí small), which is typical of sonar reflections.
* The peak values indicate strong reflections, which can differ between rock and mine due to material properties.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Approach

### ‚úÖ Common Algorithms Used:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### ‚úÖ Feature Engineering:

* All 60 features are used as input directly (as they are already normalized).
* No missing values or categorical features; ready for training.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Expected Data Behavior

* Samples labeled **Rock** tend to have smoother sonar responses.
* Samples labeled **Mine** tend to have more irregular and sharp peaks due to strong metallic reflections.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Sample Data Insights

| Sample Feature Values    | Prediction Hint               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 0.0453, 0.0523, ‚Ä¶ 0.0044 | If mostly smooth, likely Rock |
| 0.9444, 1.0, 0.8874      | Strong peak ‚Üí Might be Mine   |

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Evaluation

‚ö°Ô∏è Typically, the process involves:

1. **Splitting the Data**
   Train-Test split (e.g., 80%-20%).

2. **Model Training**
   Train the classifier on the feature vectors and corresponding labels.

3. **Performance Metrics:**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision, Recall
   * Confusion Matrix

üìä Example Performance Result (hypothetical):

* Accuracy: 87%
* Precision (Mine): 85%
* Recall (Mine): 89%

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

My dataset is a perfect candidate for binary classification models to distinguish between **Rock** and **Mine** based on sonar signal characteristics.
The well-structured, normalized data helps achieve good model performance with minimal preprocessing.
